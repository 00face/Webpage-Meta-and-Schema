## Description

"Most webmasters are familiar with HTML tags on their pages. HTML tags typically instruct the browser on how to display the enclosed information. For instance, `<h1>Avatar</h1>` directs the browser to render the text string "Avatar" as a heading 1 format. However, HTML tags lack specificity about the meaning of the content— "Avatar" could denote the popular 3D movie or a type of profile picture. This ambiguity can pose challenges for search engines in delivering relevant content to users.

Schema.org offers a comprehensive set of shared vocabularies for webmasters to annotate their pages in a manner understandable by major search engines such as Google, Microsoft, Yandex, and Yahoo!

You can employ the schema.org vocabulary in conjunction with Microdata, RDFa, or JSON-LD formats to enrich your web content. This guide aims to familiarize you with Microdata and schema.org, empowering you to incorporate markup into your web pages effectively.

While this guide primarily emphasizes Microdata, examples on the schema.org site often demonstrate RDFa and JSON-LD as well. The fundamental concepts (types, properties, etc.) outlined here extend beyond Microdata—consult the examples to explore how the specifics compare."
